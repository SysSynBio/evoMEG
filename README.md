Evolutionary Algorithm-based Model Ensemble Generation Algorithm

COPYRIGHT 2022 Kiri Choi

Evolutionary Algorithm-based Model Ensemble Generation (evoMEG) is a meta-modeling algorithm for biochemical reaction network models that generates a model ensemble from perturbation studies. This is a refactored version of the original code that works with the most recent version of libroadrunner, supporting parallel computing and direct access to model object to bypass model modification in Antimony and reloading.

## How to use

The algorithm ca be executed by simply running `main.py`. To change the algorithm settings, modify the `main.py`.
